## 1. Topline Executive Summary & Positioning

- Key call (1 sentence): directional view plus conviction (High/Medium/Low)
- Top 3 risks that could change the call (with triggers and time windows)
- Current recommended positioning (asset mix tilt, hedges, liquidity targets)

Keep bullets short; each should enable a PM to act within minutes.

## 2. Macro & Liquidity Signals

- Central bank signals and immediate policy risk (rates, balance sheet moves)
- Credit & funding stress (spreads, repo, commercial paper, EM FX)
- Real economy indicators that matter this week (PMIs, payrolls, CPI)

Include short charts or deltas where helpful. Note any asymmetric risks.

## 3. Market & Asset Opportunities

- Equity views (sectors/regions with conviction + catalysts)
- Rates & credit (positions, curve views, watch-list movers)
- FX, commodities, and alternatives (where to rotate; liquidity notes)

For each opportunity, include: thesis (2 lines), catalyst, recommended instrument(s), ideal horizon.

## 4. Geopolitical & Risk Catalysts

- Top geopolitical events and likely market impacts (timing & probability)
- Supply-chain, sanctions, or commodity-disruption notes
- Rapid escalation checklist (events that require immediate de-risking)

Frame risks by expected impact on portfolios and suggested tactical responses.

## 5. Trade Ideas, Sizing & Risk Management

- 3 prioritized trade ideas with suggested sizing (small/medium/large) and stop/hedge
- Position-sizing rules and portfolio-level risk limits to consider this week
- Pre-mortem: what would make each trade fail and exit rules

Make this section operational: tickets, ISINs/tickers, and clear exit criteria where applicable.

## 6. Appendix: Data, Sources & Short Reads

- Key data links and one-line note on reliability/timeliness (FRED, IMF, ACLED, etc.)
- Recent reports or research (1-line summaries and links)
- Methodology notes and any calculations (indicators, thresholds)

Usage notes:
- One-page weekly brief preferred; expand appendices as needed.
- Use conviction labels and explicit sizing to make the note tradeable.
- Keep raw data and charts in the appendix for audit and follow-up.
