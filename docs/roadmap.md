# Roadmap — 0 to 60: Building the WeQuo Information Pipeline

This roadmap guides the WeQuo team from concept to production for a weekly information pipeline that supports the `Weekly Global Risk & Opportunity Brief` template. It is organized into five phases that map to weeks 0→60, with clear milestones, owners, acceptance criteria, deliverables, and high-level risks/mitigations.

Principles
- Start small and iterate: deliver working components early (minimum viable pipeline) and expand coverage.
- Automate data collection, basic validation, and enrichment before human authoring.
- Make handoff to authors simple: one aggregated data package + short suggested talking points.
- Track ownership and metrics (freshness, coverage, data quality).

Summary timeline
- Phase 0: Foundations, discovery, and MVP pipeline
- Phase 1: Expand connectors, basic analytics, author tooling
- Phase 2: Automations, indexing, and internal dashboard
- Phase 3: Production hardening, scaling, and analytics
- Phase 4: Full productization, UX, and handoff to ops

---

## Phase 0: Foundations & MVP
Goal: Deliver a minimal end-to-end pipeline that ingests 3–5 core data sources, validates data, and produces an author-ready weekly package.

Milestones
- M0.1: Project kickoff, roles, and success metrics defined
- M0.2: Pick initial canonical sources (e.g., FRED, ACLED, FAO, NOAA, UN Comtrade)
- M0.3: Implement 3 connectors that auto-download or fetch APIs on schedule
- M0.4: Basic validation and normalization layer (schema and freshness checks)
- M0.5: Simple aggregator script that compiles the weekly data package (CSV/JSON + short notes)
- M0.6: First end-to-end dry-run and author feedback loop

Owners
- Product lead / editor: defines sources, acceptance criteria, and weekly requirements
- Engineer(s): build connectors, validation, aggregator script
- Data analyst: define normalization schemas and quick QA

Acceptance criteria
- Connectors run on schedule and produce stored raw files
- Validation flags missing/old data and produces a human-readable QA report
- Aggregator builds a weekly package (single JSON and short bullets) that an author can use to fill the template within 2 hours
- Authors confirm the first dry-run is usable and provide feedback

Deliverables
- Connector scripts for chosen sources (repo under `data/connectors/`)
- Validation and normalization code (`data/validate.py` or similar)
- Aggregator script and sample output in `data/output/YYYY-MM-DD/`
- Short runbook for authors (how to grab the package and where to edit the template)

Risks & mitigations
- Risk: API rate limits or auth issues → Mitigation: cache responses, add retries, request elevated access if needed
- Risk: Authors need more context than raw numbers → Mitigation: include short suggested talking points and links to original sources

---

## Phase 1: Expand coverage & author tooling
Goal: Broaden data coverage, implement lightweight analytics and author helpers to reduce time-to-publish.

Milestones
- M1.1: Add 6–10 additional connectors (commodities, shipping AIS, GitHub trends, pageviews)
- M1.2: Implement small analytics modules (deltas, percentiles, z-scores, simple anomaly detection)
- M1.3: Author web form to fetch the weekly package and open the `Template.md` with pre-filled fields
- M1.4: Basic metadata and provenance tracking for each datum (timestamps, source URL)

Owners
- Engineers: connectors, analytics modules, CLI/web form
- Data analyst: define analytics rules and thresholds
- Editor: define pre-filled bullets and checks

Acceptance criteria
- Weekly package includes analytics outputs (top 5 deltas, anomalies)
- Authors can fetch and open a pre-filled template in < 5 minutes using the tool
- Provenance metadata is attached to every metric

Deliverables
- Additional connector scripts and tests (`data/connectors/`)
- Analytics modules and a small results dashboard or JSON summary (`data/analytics/`)
- Author tooling (CLI or simple Flask/Streamlit UI)

Risks & mitigations
- Risk: Too many noisy signals → Mitigation: start with a short whitelist of trusted indicators and tune thresholds
- Risk: Complexity for non-technical authors → Mitigation: prioritize UI/CLI simplicity and clear instructions

## Phase 2: Automations, indexing, and internal dashboard
Goal: Automate scheduling, build an internal dashboard for exploration, and index all raw/reports for semantic search.

Milestones
- M2.1: Production scheduler (cron/airflow/github actions) for all connectors and analytics
- M2.2: Internal dashboard for data exploration (Grafana/Streamlit/Lightweight React)
- M2.3: Index raw data, weekly packages, and author notes into a searchable store (Elasticsearch/Weaviate/SQLite+FAISS)
- M2.4: Build exportable artifacts (PDF/HTML) for the weekly brief

Owners
- SRE/Engineers: scheduler, infra, indexing
- Frontend/Engineer: dashboard UI
- Editor/Analyst: define search tags and faceting needs

Acceptance criteria
- Automated runs complete on schedule with monitoring alerts for failures
- Searchable index returns relevant weekly packages and source documents for sample queries
- Dashboard shows freshness, top signals, and connector health

Deliverables
- Scheduler workflows and documentation 
- Dashboard prototype with instructions
- Credentials for editors
- Search index with sample queries and docs (`search/`)
- PDF/HTML export templates for the weekly brief

Risks & mitigations
- Risk: Infrastructure cost and complexity → Mitigation: start with lightweight, open-source components and deploy incrementally
- Risk: Search relevance is poor → Mitigation: iterate on metadata and embeddings; add test queries and relevance checks

## Phase 3: Production hardening, scaling, and analytics
Goal: Harden the pipeline for reliability, add more advanced analytics (change-point detection, causal flags), and scale connectors.

Milestones
- M3.1: Add monitoring & alerting (uptime, data freshness, anomaly rates)
- M3.2: Implement advanced analytics modules (time-series change-point, cross-correlation, event impact tagging)
- M3.3: Scale connectors to additional countries/indices and add datastore optimizations
- M3.4: Author review workflows (approvals, version history, editorial notes)

Owners
- SRE/Engineers: infra, monitoring, scaling
- Data scientists: advanced analytics
- Editor/Operations: staging/approval workflows

Acceptance criteria
- SLAs for data freshness and connector uptime are met (e.g., 99% scheduled runs succeed)
- Advanced analytics produce explainable flags and sample signals that align with historical events
- Authors can track and revert versions of weekly briefs

Deliverables
- Monitoring dashboards and alert rules
- Analytics library with tests, documentation, and sample notebooks
- Versioned authoring workflow (git-backed or internal CMS)

Risks & mitigations
- Risk: False positives from analytics → Mitigation: combine algorithmic flags with human-in-the-loop validation and thresholds
- Risk: Storage costs grow → Mitigation: implement retention policies and compressed archival

## Phase 4: Productization, UX, and handoff to ops
Goal: Finish UX polish, onboarding, documentation, and handoff to operations for ongoing production runs.

Milestones
- M4.1: UX polish for author tools and dashboard; accessibility review
- M4.2: Complete documentation (`docs/`) and onboarding materials
- M4.3: SLA, incident response, and cost projections finalized
- M4.4: Handoff to ops/maintenance team and a 30/60/90 day support plan

Owners
- Product/Editor: final content and workflow decisions
- Engineers/SRE: finalize infra, monitoring, backups
- Ops: take ownership of scheduled runs and incident response

Acceptance criteria
- New authors can onboard and publish a weekly brief within one week of training
- Ops own scheduled runs with documented SLAs and incident procedures
- Cost and SLA targets documented and accepted by stakeholders

Deliverables
- Finalized author UI, dashboard, and documentation (`docs/`)
- Onboarding checklist and training materials
- Handoff ticket and post-handoff support schedule

Risks & mitigations
- Risk: Drift between product vision and operations → Mitigation: joint acceptance criteria and a formal handoff review
- Risk: Team turnover → Mitigation: cross-training, documentation, and knowledge sharing

## Cross-cutting tasks & metrics

Monitoring & KPIs
- Connector health (success rate %)
- Data freshness (latency from source to package)
- Time-to-first-draft for authors (target < 4 hours in Phase 0, < 1 hour by Phase 2)
- Signal precision (human-validated useful signals / total signals)

Security & compliance
- Track credentials and secrets with vault or environment-separated configs
- Respect terms of service for each data provider and note any licensing constraints in `docs/sources.md`

Team & ownership
- Suggest a small core team for initial phases: 1 product/editor, 2 engineers, 1 data analyst/scientist
- Expand to include SRE, frontend, and ops by Phase 2–3
