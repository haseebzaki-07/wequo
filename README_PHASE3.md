#### Usage

```python
# Integrated usage via AnalyticsEngine
engine = AnalyticsEngine(enable_advanced_analytics=True)
results = engine.analyze(data_frames)

# Access advanced results
changepoints = results.changepoints
correlations = results.correlations
event_impacts = results.event_impacts
explanations = results.explanations

# Direct usage of individual modules
cp_detector = ChangePointDetector()
changepoints = cp_detector.detect_changepoints(df)

corr_analyzer = CrossCorrelationAnalyzer()
correlations = corr_analyzer.analyze_all_correlations(df)

event_tagger = EventImpactTagger()
